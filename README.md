# Documentation for main.dart

This document provides an overview and detailed explanation of the `main.dart` file, which serves as the entry point for a Flutter application. The purpose of this application is to present a login/signup interface that features a directional slide effect.

## Overview

The `main.dart` file initializes the Flutter application using the `runApp` function. It sets up the application theme, designates a home screen (the `SplashPage`), and disables the debug banner.

## Function: main

The `main` function is the entry point of the Flutter application. It is where the app starts executing.

### Usage

When the app is launched, the `main` function calls `runApp`, passing in an instance of `MyApp` as its argument, telling Flutter to start building the widget tree from there.

### Example

```dart
void main() {
    runApp(MyApp());
}
Class: MyApp
The MyApp class is a stateless widget that acts as the root of the application. It defines the overall structure and theme of the app.

Methods
build
The build method is overridden from the StatelessWidget class and is responsible for creating the user interface of the app. It constructs the widget tree, including the MaterialApp widget which provides material design functionalities.

Parameters:
context: The build context that provides information about the widget tree.
Returns:
It returns a MaterialApp widget containing the application settings.
Example
Dart

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
        title: 'Login/Signup with Directional Slide',
        theme: ThemeData(
            primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
            visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
        ),
        home: SplashPage(),
        debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
    );
}
MaterialApp Widget
The MaterialApp widget is a convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for an application that uses Material Design. Here are the significant parameters used:

title: The title of the application, which can be used by the OS if needed.
theme: Defines the overall appearance of the app, including colors and styles.
home: Sets the initial screen of the application, which is the SplashPage in this case.
debugShowCheckedModeBanner: When set to false, it hides the debug banner displayed in the top right corner of the app during debug mode.
Example
Dart

MaterialApp(
    title: 'Login/Signup with Directional Slide',
    theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
    ),
    home: SplashPage(),
    debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
)
